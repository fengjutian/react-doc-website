It uses keywords and syntax that node (as of v. 9.3.0, which we\u2019re using for this tutorial) hasn\u2019t quite caught up to just yet. It requires a fair bit of setup that can be cumbersome to figure out, and Facebook has provided an option that makes starting a React app easy. Why bother, right?\\n\\nThe thing is, create-react-app abstracts a lot of what makes a React app work away from you \u2014 at least without ejecting it and having to tweak all of the options by hand. There are a number of reasons you may want to make your own implementation, or at least have some idea of what it\u2019s doing under the hood.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, there are a couple of hurdles to starting a React app. The first is that node can\u2019t process all of the syntax (such as import/export and jsx). The second is that you\u2019ll either need to build your files or serve them somehow during development for your app to work \u2014 This is especially important in the latter situation.\\n\\nLuckily, we can handle these issues with Babel and Webpack.\\n\\n## Setup\\nTo get started, create a new directory for your React app. Then, initialize your project with `npm init` and open it in an editor of your choice. It\u2019s also a pretty good time to `git init` as well. In your new project folder, create the following structure:\\n\\n```\\n.\\n+-- public\\n+-- src\\n```\\nThinking ahead a little bit, we\u2019ll eventually want to build our app and we\u2019ll probably want to exclude the built version and our node modules from commits, so let\u2019s go ahead and add a \\n`.gitignore` file excluding (at least) the directories `node_modules` and `dist`.\\n\\nOur `public` directory will handle any static assets, and most importantly houses our `index.html` file, which react will utilize to render your app. The following code was sourced from the react documentation with some very slight modifications. Feel free to copy the following HTML markup into a new file `index.html` inside of the `public` directory.\\n\\n```html\\n\\n\x3c!-- sourced from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html --\x3e\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n\\n<head>\\n  <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\\">\\n  <title>React Starter</title>\\n</head>\\n\\n<body>\\n  <div id=\\"root\\"></div>\\n  <noscript>\\n    You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.\\n  </noscript>\\n  <script src=\\"../dist/bundle.js\\"><\/script>\\n</body>\\n\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nThe most important lines to pay attention to are 10, which is the root our React app will hook into, and line 14, which references our (soon to be) built react app. You can name your built script whatever you like, but I\u2019ll be using bundle.js for this tutorial.\\n\\nNow that we\u2019ve got our HTML page set up, we can start getting serious. We\u2019re going to need to set up a few more things. First, we need to make sure the code we write can be compiled, so we\u2019ll need Babel.\\n\\n## Babel\\nGo ahead and run `npm install --save-dev @babel/core@7.1.0 @babel/cli@7.1.0 @babel/preset-env@7.1.0 @babel/preset-react@7.0.0.`\\n\\n`babel-core` is the main babel package \u2014 We need this for babel to do any transformations on our code. `babel-cli` allows you to compile files from the command line. **[preset-react](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react)** and **[preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env)** are both presets that transform specific flavors of code \u2014 in this case, the `env` preset allows us to transform ES6+ into more traditional javascript and the `react` preset does the same, but with JSX instead.\\n\\nIn the project root, create a file called **[.babelrc](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/)**. Here, we\u2019re telling babel that we\u2019re going to use the `env` and `react` presets.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"presets\\": [\\"@babel/env\\", \\"@babel/preset-react\\"]\\n}\\n```\\nBabel also has a ton of plugins available that can be used if you only need to transform specific features or some feature you need isn\u2019t covered by env. We won\u2019t worry about those for now, but you can check them out **[here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/)**.\\n\\n## Webpack\\nNow we need to acquire and configure Webpack. We\u2019ll need a few more packages, and you\u2019ll want to save these as dev dependencies: `npm install --save-dev webpack@4.19.1 webpack-cli@3.1.1 webpack-dev-server@3.1.8 style-loader@0.23.0 css-loader@1.0.0 babel-loader@8.0.2`.\\n\\nWebpack uses **[loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)** to process different types of files for bundling. It also works easily alongside the development server that we\u2019re going to use to serve our React project in development and reload browser pages on (saved) changes to our React components. In order to utilize any of this though, we\u2019ll need to configure Webpack to use our loaders and prepare the dev server.\\n\\nCreate a new file at the root of the project called `webpack.config.js`. This file exports an object with webpack\u2019s configuration.\\n\\n```js\\nconst path = require(\\"path\\");\\nconst webpack = require(\\"webpack\\");\\n\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  entry: \\"./src/index.js\\",\\n  mode: \\"development\\",\\n  module: {\\n    rules: [\\n      {\\n        test: /\\\\.(js|jsx)$/,\\n        exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,\\n        loader: \\"babel-loader\\",\\n        options: { presets: [\\"@babel/env\\"] }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        test: /\\\\.css$/,\\n        use: [\\"style-loader\\", \\"css-loader\\"]\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  resolve: { extensions: [\\"*\\", \\".js\\", \\".jsx\\"] },\\n  output: {\\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, \\"dist/\\"),\\n    publicPath: \\"/dist/\\",\\n    filename: \\"bundle.js\\"\\n  },\\n  devServer: {\\n    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, \\"public/\\"),\\n    port: 3000,\\n    publicPath: \\"http://localhost:3000/dist/\\",\\n    hotOnly: true\\n  },\\n  plugins: [new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()]\\n};\\n```\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a quick walk through this: **[entry](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#entry)** (line 5) tells Webpack where our application starts and where to start bundling our files. The following line lets webpack know we\u2019re working in development mode \u2014 This saves us from having to add a mode flag when we run the development server.\\n\\nThe **[module](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/)** object helps define how your exported javascript modules are transformed and which ones are included according to the given array of rules.\\n\\nOur first rule is all about transforming our ES6 and JSX syntax. The test and exclude properties are conditions to match file against. In this case, it\u2019ll match anything outside of the `node_modules` and `bower_components` directories. Since we\u2019ll be transforming our `.js` and `.jsx` files as well, we\u2019ll need to direct Webpack to use Babel. Finally, we specify that we want to use the `env` preset in options.\\n\\nThe next rule is for processing CSS. Since we\u2019re not pre-or-post-processing our CSS, we just need to make sure to add `style-loader` and `css-loader` to the `use` property. `css-loader` requires `style-loader` in order to work. `loader` is a shorthand for the `use` property, when only one loader is being utilized.\\n\\nThe resolve property allows us to specify which extensions Webpack will resolve \u2014 this allows us to import modules without needing to add their extensions.\\n\\nThe output property tells Webpack where to put our bundled code. The publicPath property specifies what directory the bundle should go in, and also tells `webpack-dev-server` where to serve files from.\\n\\nThe publicPath property is a special property that helps us with our dev-server. It specifies the public URL of the the directory \u2014 at least as far as webpack-dev-server will know or care. If this is set incorrectly, you\u2019ll get 404\u2019s as the server won\u2019t be serving your files from the correct location!\\n\\nWe set up `webpack-dev-server` in the **[devServer](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)** property. This doesn\u2019t require much for our needs \u2014 just the location we\u2019re serving static files from (such as our `index.html`) and the port we want to run the server on. Note that `devServer` also has a publicPath property. This `publicPath` tells the server where our bundled code actually is.\\n\\nThat last bit might have been a little confusing \u2014 Pay really close attention here: `output.publicPath` and `devServer.publicPath` are different. Read both entries. Twice.\\n\\nFinally, since we want to use **[Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/)** so we don\u2019t have to constantly refresh to see our changes. All we do for that in terms of this file is instantiate a new instance of the plugin in the `plugins` property and make sure that we set `hotOnly` to `true` in `devServer`. We still need to set up one more thing in React before HMR works, though.\\n\\nWe\u2019re done with the heavy setup. Now let\u2019s get React working!\\n\\n## React\\n\\nFirst, we\u2019ll need to get two more packages: `react@16.5.2` and `react-dom@16.5.2`. Go ahead and save those as regular dependencies.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll need to tell our React app where to hook into the DOM (in our `index.html`). Create a file called `index.js` in your `src` directory. This is a very small file that does a lot in terms of your React app. Check it out.\\n\\n```js\\nimport React from \\"react\\";\\nimport ReactDOM from \\"react-dom\\";\\nimport App from \\"./App.js\\";\\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(\\"root\\"));\\n```\\n`ReactDOM.render` is the function that tells React what to render and where to render it \u2014 In this case, we\u2019re rendering a component called `App` (which we\u2019ll create soon), and it\u2019s being rendered at the DOM element with the ID root (line 10 of `index.html`).\\n\\nNow, create another file in `src` called `App.js`. If you\u2019ve worked with React using `create-react-app` this part should be extremely familiar. This file is just a React component.\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { Component} from \\"react\\";\\nimport \\"./App.css\\";\\n\\nclass App extends Component{\\n  render(){\\n    return(\\n      <div className=\\"App\\">\\n        <h1> Hello, World! </h1>\\n      </div>\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nexport default App;\\n```\\nWhile we\u2019re still here, I did mention that webpack also processes CSS (and we are requiring it our component). Let\u2019s add a really simple stylsheet to the src directory.\\n\\n```css\\n.App {\\n  margin: 1rem;\\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYour final project structure should look like the following, unless you changed some names along the way:\\n\\n```shell\\n.\\n+-- public\\n| +-- index.html\\n+-- src\\n| +-- App.css\\n| +-- App.js\\n| +-- index.js\\n+-- .babelrc\\n+-- .gitignore\\n+-- package-lock.json\\n+-- package.json\\n+-- webpack.config.js\\n```\\nWe now have a functioning react app! We can start our dev server by executing `webpack-dev-server --mode development` in the terminal. I would advise putting it in your `start` script in `package.json` to save yourself nine whole keystrokes.\\n\\n## Finishing HMR\\n\\nIf you run the server now, you\u2019ll notice none of your changes actually cause anything to happen in the client. What gives?\\n\\nWell, HMR needs to know what to actually replace and currently we haven\u2019t given it anything. For that, we\u2019re going to use a package one of the folks on the react team have provided us: `react-hot-loader@4.3.11`.\\n\\nYou can install this as regular dependency \u2014 as per the documentation\\n\\n:::tip\\nNote: You can safely install react-hot-loader as a regular dependency instead of a dev dependency as it automatically ensures it is not executed in production and the footprint is minimal.\\n:::\\n\\nNow, import react-hot-loader in App.js and mark the exported object as hot-reloaded by modifying to code as follows.\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { Component} from \\"react\\";\\nimport {hot} from \\"react-hot-loader\\";\\nimport \\"./App.css\\";\\n\\nclass App extends Component{\\n  render(){\\n    return(\\n      <div className=\\"App\\">\\n        <h1> Hello, World! </h1>\\n      </div>\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nexport default hot(module)(App);\\n```\\nWhen you run your app now changes to the code should update the client immediately after saving.\\n\\n## Last Details\\nYou might notice something interesting (or maybe startling) about starting your project: Built files never show up in your `dist` directory. See, `webpack-dev-server` is actually serving the bundled files from memory \u2014 once the server stops, they\u2019re gone. To actually build your files, we\u2019re going to utilize webpack proper \u2014 add a script called build in your `package.json` with the following command: `webpack --mode development`. You can replace `development` with `production`, but if you completely omit `--mode`, it will fall back to the latter and give you a warning.\\n\\nThat just about covers everything you need to be able to render a basic React app, without having to touch `create-react-app`. There\u2019s still more to add to the implementation to make it more complete though \u2014 For instance, images aren\u2019t set up to be processed by Webpack, but there\u2019s a loader for that. I\u2019ll leave that implementation to you. After all, if you don\u2019t need or want to serve files, well, that\u2019s just bloat, right?\\n\\nI hope this article helped shine some light on what it takes to get a React app working, and how the basics work under the hood. I didn\u2019t dive too deeply into details about Babel and Webpack, but please explore any of the myriad links peppered throughout the article or right into their documentation. They\u2019re awesome tools that seem more intimidating at first glance than they really are and they can help take your development to the next level.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re still unclear on any of that
